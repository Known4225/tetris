# tetris
tetris in python

to play: put tetris and turtletools in the same directory
then run python3 tetris.py in the command prompt
windows/linux compatible

arrow keys < and > to move
up arrow to rotate clockwise
z to rotate counterclockwise
esc to pause (not implemented because I'm lazy)

use flags -vf, -tps, and -fps to turn off variable framerate, fix the tps, and display the fps in command prompt
